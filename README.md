# The-Fall

### An ordinary glitch situation

What happens when you play casually a simple platformer and your computer system runs into a fatal glitch? That’s the question I asked myself when developing this little game/experience. Entirely made in Processing, The Fall let the user play this character who get stuck into a computer bug and tries to reboot the system before it’s too late. Originally made in Spring 2017, this software was the first game experience that I had the chance to create.

### Important notes
This project was initialy made in April 2017. New updates from Processing may crash the entire app. It was develop on  MAC and if running on windows, it may also crash the app.
